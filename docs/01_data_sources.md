# Data sources

## What we need
- Scanned pages (preferably printed/typographic or lithographic).
- Permissions for research usage (even if data is not publicly released).
- Minimal labeled subset: line crops + transcriptions.

## Candidate sources
- Local archives / libraries / museum collections (Kazan/Moscow).
- Institutional projects (university labs / digital humanities initiatives).
- Private collections (with explicit permission).

## Access log (fill in)
| Date | Contact | Institution | Material type | Access status | Notes |
|------|---------|-------------|---------------|--------------|------|
|      |         |             | printed/handwritten | pending/approved/denied |      |

## Data handling notes
- Raw scans must not be committed to git.
- Store locally under `data/raw/` and document access constraints in `docs/04_ethics_and_licenses.md`.
